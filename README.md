# Aether

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Hey! This is Aether, a small web app that removes backgrounds from images with AI. It's built with:

* BRIA AI's RMBG-1.4
* transformers.js
* Remix.run
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel

... and some sweat. Thanks to the authors of the libraries and tools used in this project!

The project is neither tested nor well commented, sorry about that. ðŸ˜…
